### Objectives

The United States continues to spend more on healthcare than any other nation. As a result, the cost of many health practices that public health officials advocate for often becomes prohibitive for a large population. Although the conversation pertaining to healthcare accessibility and affordability has become overtly political, it is important for us as public health students to be aware of the state of health and healthcare in this country, since it directly affects our field. As students of public health, we wanted to explore differences in health practices and outcomes. We did this by analyzing the following associations:  

* Lack of health insurance with health practices

* Health practices with health outcome

* Regional health expenditure


### Dataset

[<img src = "images/500-cities-logo.png" style="width:50%">](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/about.htm)

This data is taken from the 500 Cities Project, which analyzes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in order to provide estimates for chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use. Data is provided for the 500 largest cities in the US. From the original dataset, we narrowed down the variable to include 9 health outcomes and 10 health practices -- refer to our [data dictionary](data_dictionary.html) for variable descriptions. Data on state healthcare expenditure per capita was taken from the [Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-spending-per-capita/?currentTimeframe=0) and merged with our existing data. 



### Conclusions

We found that there is a negative correlation between lack of health insurance and prevalence of proactive health practices, which include screening for diseases, and a positive correlation between variables pertaining to poor physical health. The notable exception was the routine checkups variable. There was no association between percent uninsured and the prevalence of routine checkups. This could indicate that there is a cost factor to these associations.
Having established an association between insurance and preventative care, we found that the health practice variables from the dataset have the most predictive power for prevalence of cancer, and the least for high cholesterol. Intuitively, this makes sense for a couple of reasons. First, cholesterol levels are highly related to genetics, and this dataset has no variables collected on genetics. Also, many of the practices measured by this dataset are cancer screening practices. 
Cancer screening and other proactive health practices that we have mentioned tend to be very expensive, particularly for the uninsured. Since we know cost is often prohibitive, we next wanted to see if healthcare expenditure is uniform across the United States. Regional health expenditure analysis showed that there is a significant difference in healthcare expenditure between regions. Of course the relationships between all of our variables is incredibly complex, however our analysis provides some interesting insights into a very complex subject.
